 # Program: Rote-memorization
 ## Author: patryk8code
 
### Description:
   This program was created out of a personal need to improve memorization efficiency,
   particularly in situations where time constraints made deeper study impossible.
   It's a simple tool that supports rote learning — repetitive, mechanical memorization —
   through flashcard-style question-and-answer loops.
 
  Use it wisely: this tool is best suited for memorizing dry or factual material —
  vocabulary, formulas, dates, basic definitions. 
  It's *not* a substitute for real understanding.
  
  Deeper subjects deserve focus, reflection, and conceptual insight.
  Rote memorization can be a useful shortcut or a last resort — 
  but it should never replace thoughtful, active learning where it truly matters.
 
### Features (current or planned):
  - Flashcard mode with customizable Q&A sets
  - Randomized question order for better recall
  - Simple performance tracking (e.g., correct/incorrect count)
  - Easy input via external text files
  - Session review options
